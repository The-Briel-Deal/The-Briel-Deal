Right now I spend most of my free time on a wayland compositor I'm building with wlroots called [GFWL](https://github.com/The-Briel-Deal/gfwl). If you're interested in working on something with me shoot me an email at gabe@fordltc.net.

I currently work at Google on endpoint forensics and [GRR](https://github.com/google/grr).
